Chapter 2 - Pattern Matching
------

**= a match operator** | Assignment in Elixir is a pattern match. The left side of assignment (=) is called a **match clause** and right side of = is called a **value**. If both sides of = operator has same structure and each item in match clause can be matched with the corresponding term in the values then match is succeeded. This process is called **pattern matching**.  

> Joe Armstrong, Erlang’s creator, compares the equals sign in Erlang to that used in algebra. When you write the equation x = a + 1, you are not assigning the value of a + 1 to x. Instead you’re simply asserting that the expressions x and a + 1 have the same value. If you know the value of x, you can work out the value of a, and vice versa.
