Chapter 2 - Pattern Matching
------

** = a match operator** | Assignment in Elixir is a pattern match. The left side of assignment (=) is called a match clause and right side of = is called a value. If both sides of = oprator has same structure and each item in match clause can be matched with the corresponding term in the values then match is succeded. this process is called **pattern matching**  

**Parallel  Processing** | Elixir can run functions in parallel. It provides powerful mechanism for passing messages between them.
